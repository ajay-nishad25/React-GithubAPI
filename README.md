# Introduction
In this project, I have utilized the power of React and Axios to fetch data from the GitHub API and display it on the screen in a user-friendly manner.

The main objective of our project is to provide users with a convenient way to view important information about GitHub users. By leveraging the GitHub API and the versatile Axios library, we can retrieve data such as a user's username, bio, total number of repositories, languages used, location, company name, followers, following and account creation date etc.

# NOTE
This React web app has been specifically designed for large-screen devices such as laptops, desktop computers, and tablets. Please note that it may not provide an optimal experience on smartphones due to its utilization of the entire screen to display data in a simplified and comprehensive form.

While the app may still be accessible on smartphones, it is recommended to use it on devices with larger screens to fully appreciate the user interface and the data presentation. 

# Error 403
Receiving an Axios error with a status code of 403 indicates that you are facing an "Unauthorized" issue while accessing the GitHub API. The 403 status code means that the server understood the request but is refusing to fulfill it due to insufficient permissions or authentication issues.

Because the GitHub API has rate limits in place to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. If you make too many requests in a short period of time, you may exceed the rate limit and receive a 403 error.

"I haven't used a GitHub API access token ðŸ™‚, so please try again later if you encounter a 403 error."
